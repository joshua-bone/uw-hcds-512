The purpose of this assignment is to explore bias in the quality of English Wikipedia articles about politicians in various countries. (See the [assignment description](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2018)/Assignments#A2:_Bias_in_data) for further details).

##### Instructions: 
Run '512a2.ipynb' as a Jupyter notebook.
Run all cells to used local cached data, retrieved by the author from the ORES API, or else change the USE_CACHED_API_RESULTS to equal False before running all cells, to make the API calls at runtime. (Be warned, runtime may be 5-10 minutes in this case).
