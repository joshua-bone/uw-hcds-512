    "# Exploring Bias In the Quality of Political Wikipedia Articles Per Country\n",
    "**Joshua Bone**  \n",
    "**November 1, 2018**  \n",
    "**UW DATA 512, Assignment 2**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to explore bias in the quality of English Wikipedia articles about politicians in various countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Article quality is judged by a machine learning system known as the \"[Objective Revision Evaluation Service](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES)\", or ORES, which has a publicly available API for assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles. Article quality is rated on the following scale (from highest to lowest quality):\n",
    "    - FA, or \"Featured Article\"\n",
    "    - GA, or \"Good Article\"\n",
    "    - B, or \"B-class Article\"\n",
    "    - C, or \"C-class Article\"\n",
    "    - Start, or \"Start-class Article\"\n",
    "    - Stub, or \"Stub-class Article\"\n",
    "For the purposes of this study, we define **FA** and **GA** articles as high quality, and the rest as low quality.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Data\n",
    "#### Political Articles By Country\n",
    "This dataset lists English Wikipedia articles on various politicians along with their nationality. It has been made available by Oliver Keyes on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449) under the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Population Data By Country\n",
    "This original version of the data comes from the \"Population mid-2018\" dataset available for download at [PRB](https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table/). This data has been modified and is available on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5u7sy1xt7g0oi2c/WPDS_2018_data.csv?dl=0). This notebook uses the modified version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Population Data Supplements\n",
    "Population data for 4 additional countries not represented in the PRB dataset were gathered from the [World Population API](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/world-population).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "<p>Overall, the study was inconclusive. Some results showed likely bias, for example, 3 of the 4 largest countries in the world occupied the bottom 3 spots for numbers of high quality articles per capita, but the United States (the 3rd most populous country) did not show up on that list. The two countries at the top of the list for percentage of all articles that are high quality, North Korea and Saudi Arabia, seem like they could be in those spots due to their disproportionately high level of interest to the West (national security in the first case, and oil in the second). \n",
    "<p>However, I found the rest of the results completely surprising, even baffling. The factors I would have predicted to lead to a high percentage of high quality English articles would have been:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- GDP\n",
    "- So-called 'first-world' status (i.e. the U.S., Canada, and the E.U.)\n",
    "- English speaking countries\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> In fact, I did find some support for my theories. The U.S. did appear on the list for percentage of articles that are high quality. However, it only placed at number 9. I found that 17 of the 46 countries having NO high quality political articles were African nations, including 7 of the top 9 countries by population in that category.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> Central African Republic, consistently ranked as one of the world's poorest and least developed countries, appeared at number 3, blowing all of my theories out of the water. In fact, 3 African countries appeared on that top 10 list, all of them ranking in the bottom half by GDP and GDP per capita of countries on that continent. The only European Union country to make the list was Romania, at number 4. I am unable to explain these results. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> Additionally, there were surprising contrasts in the data. The country of Bhutan, a landlocked region in the Himalayas, ranked as number 6 on the percentage of articles that are high quality. However, its neighbor Nepal, 40 miles to the west, was tied with 45 other countries for last place, having no high quality political articles. 17 underdeveloped African countries did show up as having zero high quality articles. But then 3 others from this region made the top 10 list. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> In summary, more research would be needed to draw any strong conclusions from this data. It would be a mistake to accept the results where they appear to confirm the hypothesized factors, without having an explanation for the strange outliers discovered in this study."

    "### 10 Countries With Highest Percentages Of High Quality Articles\n",
    "There is no clear pattern to the countries having the highest quality articles. North Korea leads the pack with nearly 18% of the articles being high quality, which is perhaps not surprising given their high levels of political tension with the West. Saudi Arabia comes in at \\#2, which could make sense given their historical importance as an oil-producing ally of the West. The United States unsurprisingly appears on the list, but only at \\#9. Other than those three, I think the results are quite surprising. Three of the top 10 (Central African Republic, Mauritania, and Benin) are relatively impoverished African nations (see Wikipedia article, [List of African countries by GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal))). Two are tiny island nations (Tuvalu and Dominica). The landlocked Himalayan nation of Bhutan makes the list as well. The only member of the European Union present in the top 10 is Romania."

    "As it turns out, there are 46 countries that have do not have any high quality articles (about 23% of all countries in the dataset). It would be meaningless to make a table of the bottom 10, so instead we can simply list the countries that are tied for lowest in this category. We include their populations to make it easier to identify trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that there is a clear trend here, with 17 of the 46 countries on the list (and 7 of the top 9 by population) being African nations. Nepal and Kazakhstan in Central Asia are not surprising in the top 10, being about as remote, both geographically and politically, from the English speaking world as one could get. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is very surprising is the geographical contrast with the top 10 countries by highest quality percentage. Nepal has zero high quality articles, but its neighbor Bhutan (just 40mi away) is \\#6 in the world for percentage of high quality articles. Cameroon has zero high quality articles, but its neighbor Central African Republic--currently the poorest nation in the world according to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-25-poorest-countries-in-the-world-2016-4?r=UK&IR=T#2-democratic-republic-of-congo--gdp-per-capita-753-525-24)--is \\#3 in the world for percentage of high quality articles."
